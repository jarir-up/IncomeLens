# Progress — PakkiFile

What's done lives in closed issues and merged PRs. This file holds only what they don't show. Keep each entry to one line.

## Waiting on owner

Q-1 to Q-15 settled 2026-10-30 (ADR-0012, 0030 to 0041; DESIGN.md; RULES R-22).

- **ADR-0042 (Proposed): PyYAML and psycopg 3.** Blocks brief 01 tickets 02 to 06. Recommend approve.
- **Licence variant.** ADR-0031 says AGPL-3.0; `pyproject.toml` uses `AGPL-3.0-only`. Recommend `-only`, so future licence versions need your choice.

## Broke

## Next

1. Owner creates the GitHub repo; then push `main` and the brief branches, open one PR each, and switch the tracker to GitHub issues.
2. Brief 00 is verified locally only; CI pass and fail-on-lint are unobserved until the repo exists.
3. Brief 01: ticket 01 done; tickets 02 to 06 wait on ADR-0042 and one dependency install.
