"""CI gate: a second model reviews the pull request diff against docs/RULES.md.

The model that wrote the code always believes it followed the rules, so the
reviewer is a different model with no access to the author's reasoning.
Blocks the merge on any violation the owner hasn't waived in the PR
description with a line like `waive R-07: <reason>`.

Standard library only, so CI needs no install step.
Env: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (required), RULES_GATE_MODEL, BASE_REF, MAX_DIFF_CHARS.
